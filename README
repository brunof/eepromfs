Bugs Known:

Bugs Fixed:
* eepromfs_fileSize() has been corrected
* and other bugs founded in eerpomfs_fileWrite() and eepromfs_getEmptyBlock() had been fixed...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

ToDO:
* replace eepromfs_getAddress() by a simple privated (not included in the public header) getAddress().
* maybe the auxiliary's functions should not be in the header. You should create a filemem_private.h.
* eepromfs_fileRead();
* eepromfs_fileCopy();
* other relevant functions that may occur...
